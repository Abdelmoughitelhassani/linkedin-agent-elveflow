New Conference Report from MicroTAS 2025 🦘🧪
We are pleased to share our conference report from MicroTAS 2025 in Adelaide 🇦🇺🔬, where Elveflow participated as a sponsor with a booth, a workshop, a poster, and a TechTalk. The event once again highlighted the strong momentum of the microfluidics community 🚀, and marked the first MicroTAS edition held in the Southern Hemisphere 🌍.
Our recap covers key scientific trends, standout topics, and insights from this year's talks 📈💡, for both attendees and those who could not join the conference.

=== POST 2: PRODUCT FEATURE (Bubble Remover) ===
Type: Product Highlight
Tone: Technical yet accessible, Problem-Solution format

Content:
No Bubble. No Trouble. Just Stable Flow.
In microfluidics, even the tiniest bubbles can disturb your flow stability, damage cells, or interrupt continuous experiments.
That's why we designed the Elveflow Microfluidic Bubble Remover, a simple yet powerful solution to keep your experiments free from bubbles.
✅ Remove air bubbles in-line before they reach your chip
✅ Biocompatible and autoclavable equipment
✅ Compatible with standard 1/32", 1/16″ and 1/8″ OD tubing
✅ Avoid contamination by changing the hydrophobic membrane easily
Use it together with the Elveflow Bubble Detector for complete bubble management, prevention and detection, to safeguard your most sensitive experiments.

=== POST 3: RESEARCH/APPLICATION NOTE ===
Type: Research Update / Publication
Tone: Scientific, Collaborative, Celebratory

Content:
🔬 Always pushing research forward
We have just updated our application note "High-resolution microfluidic device for precise oil-in-water emulsion and coalescence analysis" following the recent publication of the results in ACS Omega.
This work presents a high-resolution microfluidic approach that enables precise control and in-depth analysis of oil-in-water emulsions and droplet coalescence dynamics, an essential step for researchers working on formulation, stability studies, and advanced emulsion characterization.
🙌 A special thanks to Reverson Fernandes Quero for his work on the application note, and congratulations to the entire team for the publication. 🎉
